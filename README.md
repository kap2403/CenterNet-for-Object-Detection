# CenterNet for Object Detection

CenterNet is an object detection model that uses a center-heatmap approach for detecting objects. This repository provides an implementation of CenterNet based on a ResNet backbone (e.g., ResNet18). The model predicts object locations by generating heatmaps (classification) and bounding box regressions.

## Introduction

This repository implements a CenterNet-based model using a ResNet backbone for object detection tasks. The architecture is based on the original CenterNet approach, where the network predicts the object center locations via heatmaps, followed by bounding box regression for localization. This approach is simpler than traditional anchor-based methods like Faster R-CNN, and has proven to be both efficient and effective in various tasks.

### Requirements

To run this model, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch (>=1.8)
- torchvision (>=0.9)
- OpenCV (for image manipulation)
- NumPy
- tqdm (for progress bars)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy matplotlib tqdm
```

## Features

- **CenterNet Object Detection**: Detects objects in images using center-heatmap based regression.
- **Flexible Backbone**: Use ResNet18 or ResNet34 as the backbone for feature extraction.
- **Upsampling Decoder**: A U-Net-like decoder that upsamples the feature maps and predicts the object locations.
- **Easy to Customize**: Can easily be adapted to different backbones, image sizes, and output formats.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/centernet.git
cd centernet
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure that the dataset is prepared in the correct format and placed in the appropriate directory (`data/` by default).

## Configuration

Configuration for training and inference is done via the `config.json` file. Here's an example of how it should look:

```json
{
    "MODEL_PATH": "path_to_pretrained_model.pth",
    "input_size": 512,
    "IN_SCALE": 2,
    "MODEL_SCALE": 4,
    "batch_size": 2,
    "model_name": "resnet18",
    "TRAIN": true
}
```

- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to the pretrained model (if continuing training or using for inference).
- `input_size`: The input image size (default is 512).
- `IN_SCALE`: Scale factor for input images.
- `MODEL_SCALE`: Scale factor for model (adjust based on network design).
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training.
- `model_name`: Backbone model to use (`resnet18`, `resnet34`).
- `TRAIN`: Boolean flag to indicate whether to train the model or not.

## Model Architecture

### Backbone

- **ResNet18** (or ResNet34): The backbone is a pre-trained ResNet18/34, from which the fully connected layers and average pooling are removed.

### Decoder

- **Upsample Blocks**: The feature maps are progressively upsampled using a custom `UpSample` module. This module includes convolution layers to refine the features after each upsampling step.

### Output Layers

- **Classification**: The output of the network is a heatmap (center locations of objects).
- **Regression**: The network also predicts bounding box regression offsets.

### Forward Pass

The forward pass involves:
1. Passing the input image through the ResNet backbone.
2. Upsampling the feature maps using the decoder blocks.
3. Generating the classification heatmap and regression outputs.

## Training

To train the model, you need to run the following script:

```bash
python train.py
```

Make sure to update `config.json` with your dataset location and training parameters. The training script will load the dataset, apply transformations, and start the training process.

### Training Workflow

- **Data Loading**: The dataset should be in a folder structure where each image is associated with its heatmap and regression target.
- **Loss Function**: The model uses a custom loss function to compute the classification loss (binary cross-entropy) and regression loss (smooth L1 loss).
- **Optimization**: We use Adam optimizer for training.

## Inference

To run inference on an image or video, you can use the following script:

```bash
python inference.py --input path_to_image_or_video --output path_to_output_image_or_video
```

You can specify a path to either an image or a video file. The model will load the weights from the path specified in the `config.json` file (`MODEL_PATH`) and will output the predicted bounding boxes.

For image inference, the script will output the image with bounding boxes overlaid on it. For video inference, it will output a video with real-time object detection.

### Example Usage:

```bash
python inference.py --input test_image.jpg --output output_image.jpg
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model on a test set, you can modify the `test.py` script to compute metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP). Evaluation is done by comparing predicted bounding boxes with ground truth annotations.

### Example:

```bash
python test.py --test_dir path_to_test_images
```
